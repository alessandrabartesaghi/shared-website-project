    <br>
    My parents came from Bosnia to Italy many years ago, so I was born in Italy.
    <br>
    The first passion I discovered was volleyball, when I was 8 years old. And I'm still playing it at a competitive level!
    <br>
    Then I became passionate about languages and different cultures, that have always fascinated me, since I was alrady between two.
    Therefore in addition to English I studied German and Spanish at high school. At the university I started studying Japanese, that allowed me to go to Japan for a semestser.
    After that I decided to keep studying it along with German during the master's course.
    <br>
    At least but not last I love reading books, especially the ones where you can't understand how is it going to finish until the end.
